# SIR Model with Deaths for Cholera in Nairobi

This project involves simulating the **SIR Model with Deaths** for a cholera outbreak in Nairobi, Kenya, using Quarto and Python. The model helps to understand the epidemic's dynamics and provides key values such as the basic reproduction number (R_0) and the percentage of the population that needs to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.

## Project Overview

This Quarto document describes the SIR model with deaths applied to the cholera outbreak in Nairobi, using the following structure:

-   **Introduction**: Outlines the purpose of the model and how it works.

-   **Modeling the SIR Model with Deaths**: Explains the compartments in the SIR model: Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, and Deceased.

-   **Model Parameters**: Defines the initial conditions, transmission rate, recovery rate, and death rate.

-   **Calculating (R_0)**: Shows how to calculate the basic reproduction number.

-   **Vaccination Threshold**: Calculates the percentage of the population that needs to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.

-   **Conclusion**: Summarizes the insights gained from the SIR model.
