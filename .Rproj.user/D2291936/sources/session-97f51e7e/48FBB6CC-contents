## Introduction

This document describes the SIR model with deaths applied to the cholera outbreak in Nairobi, Kenya, using a manual approach without the aid of Python code. We use initial outbreak data, calculate the basic reproduction number \( R_0 \), and estimate the percentage of the population that needs to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.

## Modeling the SIR Model with Deaths

The SIR model divides the population into four compartments:

- **Susceptible (S):** Individuals who can contract the disease.
- **Infected (I):** Individuals who have contracted the disease and can transmit it.
- **Recovered (R):** Individuals who have recovered from the disease and gained immunity.
- **Deceased (D):** Individuals who have died from the disease.

The system of differential equations governing the dynamics of the disease is:

$$
\frac{dS}{dt} = - \beta \frac{S I}{N}
$$

$$
\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta \frac{S I}{N} - \gamma I - \mu I
$$

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I
$$

$$
\frac{dD}{dt} = \mu I
$$

Where \( N = S + I + R + D \) is the total population. The parameters are:
- \( \beta \): Transmission rate of the disease.
- \( \gamma \): Recovery rate (inverse of the recovery period).
- \( \mu \): Death rate due to the disease.

## Model Parameters

For the cholera outbreak in Nairobi, the following initial conditions were used:

- Total population \( N = 4,400,000 \)
- Initial infected individuals \( I_0 = 1,172 \)
- Initial recovered individuals \( R_0 = 0 \)
- Initial deaths \( D_0 = 58 \)
- Initial susceptible population \( S_0 = N - I_0 - R_0 - D_0 = 4,398,770 \)
- Recovery rate \( \gamma = 1/7 = 0.14286 \)
- Death rate \( \mu = 0.04949 \)

## Calculating \( R_0 \)

The basic reproduction number \( R_0 \) is given by:

$$
R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}
$$

Using an estimated transmission rate of \( \beta = 0.35 \) (based on observed data) and a recovery rate of \( \gamma = 0.14286 \):

$$
R_0 = \frac{0.35}{0.14286} \approx 2.45
$$

This \( R_0 \) value suggests that, on average, each infected individual will spread the disease to 2.45 others.

## Calculating the Percentage of the Population to be Vaccinated

The percentage of the population required to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity is calculated using the following formula:

$$
\text{Herd Immunity Threshold} = 1 - \frac{1}{R_0}
$$

Substituting \( R_0 = 2.45 \):

$$
\text{Herd Immunity Threshold} = 1 - \frac{1}{2.45} \approx 0.59184
$$

Thus, approximately **59.18%** of the population needs to be vaccinated to prevent the further spread of cholera and achieve herd immunity.

## Conclusion

The SIR model with deaths provides valuable insights into the transmission dynamics of the cholera outbreak in Nairobi. With a basic reproduction number of 2.45, the disease has a high potential for transmission, emphasizing the need for timely interventions. Vaccinating approximately 59.18% of the population would help achieve herd immunity and curb the spread of the disease.
